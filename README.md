# Katas-with-tests

In this repository I will be uploading all the katas I have been doing in Codewars, using JavaScript.

Mainly, I will be using TDD to solve them, and I will be using Jest as my testing framework.

For each function, the kata must have several tests that check the different possible cases.

## How to use it

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the tests with `npm test`
